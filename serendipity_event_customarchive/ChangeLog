1.13: 
    * The standard link to the archive /pages/archives.html causes the default 
      builtin archive to be displayed beneath the customarchive. This is
      caused by the matching in index.php with the 'archives' keyword.
      To disable that, change it to something else. It also does work with
      a relative link and without the .html like /sortarchiv
    * added a sidebar plugin instead of the html nugget. The plugin also 
      uses the relative path and shows an option to display a link to
      the builtin archive if it is not displayed underneath.
    * made the plugin multilingual: added a field for language-based-search,
      check for the settings of multilingual plugin (if installed), strips the
      tagged translations from the categories, if the plugin is above the 
      multilingual plugin in the plugin list, show all entries even if
      the option is set to hide untranslated articles in the regular blog
    * displays now a message if the result was empty
    * reformated the search mask

1.12:
-----
* Propagate $smarty.env.staticpage_pagetitle (and the others) so that
  it can be used in entries.tpl
* Latest: Smarty3 forward compatibility

1.11:
-----
Added new smarty function to allow building for archive overviews based
on custom entryproperties. See the serendipity_event_customarchive.php file
for example use of the Smarty function, that you can for example use
on static pages using the Smarty Markup plugin. The entryproperties plugin
is required to enter the metadata that this plugin operates on.
